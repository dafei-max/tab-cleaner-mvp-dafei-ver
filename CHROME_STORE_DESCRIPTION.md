Tab Cleaner MVP is a powerful and intelligent browser tab management extension that helps you efficiently organize, search, and visualize your browser tabs. Whether you're a researcher, developer, or knowledge worker who frequently opens dozens of tabs, Tab Cleaner MVP transforms your cluttered browser into an organized, searchable workspace.

🎯 **Core Features:**

**1. One-Click Tab Cleanup**
Instantly collect and organize all your open tabs with a single click. Tab Cleaner MVP automatically extracts metadata (title, description, and thumbnail) from each tab, creating a visual card for easy identification.

**2. Personal Space Canvas**
Experience your tabs like never before with an interactive canvas interface. Drag, zoom, and explore your tab collection in a beautiful, visual format. The canvas supports both radial clustering view and masonry grid view, giving you flexibility in how you organize your workspace.

**3. AI-Powered Semantic Search**
Find exactly what you're looking for using natural language. Our advanced AI search understands context and meaning, not just keywords. Search by text description or even by uploading an image to find visually similar tabs. Powered by state-of-the-art multimodal AI technology.

**4. Smart Clustering**
Let AI automatically group your tabs by theme and topic. Or create custom clusters manually to organize tabs according to your workflow. The intelligent clustering system helps you discover patterns and relationships in your browsing habits.

**5. Visual Management Tools**
- Manual selection: Click to select individual tabs
- Lasso selection: Draw around multiple tabs to select them
- Custom grouping: Create and name your own tab clusters
- Drag and drop: Organize tabs intuitively on the canvas

**6. Document Page Support**
Special handling for documentation sites (GitHub, technical docs, Notion, etc.) with automatic screenshot generation and visual card creation, ensuring all your important resources are properly visualized.

🔒 **Privacy & Security:**

Your privacy is our top priority. Tab Cleaner MVP:
- Only processes tabs when you actively click the "Clean" button
- Stores all data locally on your device (chrome.storage.local)
- Does not monitor or track your browsing behavior
- Does not collect personal information or browsing history
- All AI processing is done securely via encrypted HTTPS connections
- No data is shared with third parties or used for advertising
